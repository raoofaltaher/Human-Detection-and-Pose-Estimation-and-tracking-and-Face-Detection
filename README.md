# Human-Detection-and-Pose-Estimation-and-tracking-and-Face-Detection
This project utilizes innovative computer vision technologies, specifically MediaPipe and YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once Version 8), to perform human pose estimation and face detection. The program processes video input extracts human figures using YOLOv8, and then applies pose estimation and face detection on these figures.
